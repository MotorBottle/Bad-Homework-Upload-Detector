# Bad-Homework-Upload-Filter
The script finds those who upload files without putting them in a folder and rename as required, for TAs' conveinece. The script assumes the directory contains .zip files (or 7z/rar/tar) of each student's upload.

For good homework uploads, they are supposed to be in a folder when being extracted. For example, in my school the folder should be renamed by StudentID-Date-HwNumber

Some students just upload without putting them in a folder, this would be very troublesome for teachers or TAs.

This script automatically deal with the 2 types of uploadings. And as we require students upload using .zip format, tar/rar files would also be put into the BadUpload folder
